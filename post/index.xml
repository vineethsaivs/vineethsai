      <description>Predicting Fuel Efficiency of Vehicles In this series, we&amp;rsquo;d be going from data collection to deploying the Machine Learning model:
  Data Collection- we are using the classic Auto MPG dataset from UCI ML Repository.
  Define Problem Statement - We&amp;rsquo;ll frame the problem based on the dataset description and initial exploration.
  EDA - Carry our exploratory analysis to figure out the important features and creating new combination of features.</description>
